# Project Name
Melanoma_Detection_Assignment

## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
It is a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

## Conclusions
The training accuracy seems to be nearly ~90%.
The validation accuracy is nearly ~80%
